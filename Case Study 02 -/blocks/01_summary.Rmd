In this study, two population's BMI are compared: postgraduate students in Electrical Engineering at UFMG in the semesters 2016-2 and 2017-2. The BMI value is used as a student lifestyle indicator. However, as it is known, the BMI alone isn't a good indicator to summarize it. So, for this study, each population will be divided into two genres, masculine and feminine and their BMI will be compared in three different scenarios:

1. between men and women (considering both semesters);
2. between men from 2016-2 semester and 2017-2 semester;
3. between women from 2016-2 semester and 2017-2 semester.

Therefore, next in this study, each experiment will be discussed and how the data were treated for each of them, alongside an exploratory analysis of it. Then, each experiment will be tested and the model assumptions' checked.
