The boxplot in the left indicates a high probability of an outlier at male samples. It also demonstrates a trend that males have a higher BMI than females.

The histogram at right, goes more in-depth into this analysis, showing that only one male sample has BMI greater than 35. It also demonstrates that female distribution has a smaller BMI than men.


```{r exploreData_hist1, include=FALSE}
hgA <- hist(male_students$IMC, breaks = 12)
hgB <- hist(female_students$IMC)

```



```{r exploreData}
