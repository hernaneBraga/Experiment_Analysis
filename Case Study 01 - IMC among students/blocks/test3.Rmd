The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is a non-parametric test alternative for Studentâ€™s t-test. It tests the null hypothesis that the means of both groups differ by a value of , here considered $\mu=0$ (equal means). 

```{r wilcox}
wilcox.test(female_students2016$IMC, female_students2017$IMC)
```

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test resulted in p-value of 0.0727 implying that the means of both groups differ by a value that is not equal to zero.
