To evaluete the test, the Fligner-Killen test of homogeneity of variances is used to compare both genres population's variances. THen, the residue from the difference between an observation and its population's mean is also presented.

```{r results='hold'}
FvsM= stack(list(Female=female_students$IMC, Male=male_students$IMC))
fligner.test(values~ind,FvsM) # OK
```

```{r}
resid <- tapply(X = FvsM$values, INDEX = FvsM$ind, FUN = function(x){x - mean(x)})
stripchart(x = resid,vertical = TRUE,pch = 16,cex = 1.5,las = 1,xlab = "mean",ylab = "residuals", main = "Stripchart - Residue from Female and Male population's mean")
```

With these results, there is no evidence that for rejecting $H_0$.
