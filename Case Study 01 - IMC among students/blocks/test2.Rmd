In this test, assuming that the variance in both populations are equal,

```{r results='hold'}
t_test_male_2016_7 <- stack(list(Male_2016=male_students2016$IMC, Male_2017=male_students2017$IMC))
t.test(values~ind,t_test_male_2016_7, var.equal = TRUE)
```
Given that the p-value of the two sample t-test resulted in $\alpha > 0.5923$, the $H_0$ is rejected. Therefore, the means in both populations are different with a 95% confidence level.
