The first experiment's null hypothesis explicits that there is no difference between man or woman BMI means, given that this indicator doesn't incorporates genre in its calculation. Therefore, our alternative hypothesis is that there is some difference between genre that reflects into how the means varies.
$$
\begin{cases} H_0: \overline{\mu_1} = \overline{\mu_2}&\\H_1: \overline{\mu_1} \neq \overline{\mu_2}\end{cases}
$$
In the hypothesis presented, $\overline{\mu_1}$ represents the male BMI's mean and $\overline{\mu_2}$ the female BMI's mean. The hypothesis will be tested using a t-test, assuming that the samples have a normal distribution, equal variance and are independent samples. The defined characteristics of the test are:

- Significance level: 0.05
- Power level: 0.9
