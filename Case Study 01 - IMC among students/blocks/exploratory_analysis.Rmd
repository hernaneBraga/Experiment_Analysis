The boxplot below indicates a high probability of an outlier at male samples. It also demonstrates a trend that males have a higher BMI than females.


```{r exploreData}
# Boxplot analysis

boxplot(male_students$IMC, female_students$IMC, main="BMI Analysis", col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
        ylab="BMI Value")


legend("topright", inset=.02, title="Gender",
       c("Male","Female"), fill=(c("gold","darkgreen")), horiz=TRUE, cex=0.8)
```

The histogram below goes more in-depth into this analysis, showing that only one male sample has BMI greater than 35. It also demonstrates that female distribution has a smaller BMI than men.


```{r exploreData_hist1, include=FALSE}
hgA <- hist(male_students$IMC, breaks = 12)
hgB <- hist(female_students$IMC)

```

```{r exploreData_hist2}

# Code of the hidden cell above
#hgA <- hist(male_students$IMC, breaks = 12)
#hgB <- hist(female_students$IMC)

plot(hgA, col ='gold', xlim = c(13,40), xlab = 'BMI', main ='BMI Histogram')
plot(hgB, add = TRUE, col = 'darkgreen')

legend("topright", inset=.02, title="Gender",
       c("Male","Female"), fill=(c("gold","darkgreen")), horiz=TRUE, cex=0.75)
